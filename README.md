Explainable Machine Learning Model for ICU Readmission Risk Prediction📌 Project OverviewICU readmission is a critical hospital care issue often related to premature discharge or avoidable complications. This project proposes an interpretable machine learning model to predict the risk of ICU readmission within 30 days of discharge.Unlike traditional "black-box" models, this system prioritizes explainability alongside predictability. It utilizes the CatBoost algorithm trained on hospital discharge data, employs SMOTE-Tomek for class imbalance, and integrates SHAP and LIME to provide clinical reasoning behind every prediction.Live Demo: Click here to access the Real-Time Prediction App 🚀 Key FeaturesHigh-Performance Classification: Utilizes CatBoost, a gradient boosting algorithm optimized for categorical features and medical datasets.Imbalanced Data Handling: Implements SMOTE-Tomek (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique + Tomek Links) to handle the scarcity of readmission cases and improve sensitivity .Explainable AI (XAI):SHAP (Global): Visualizes feature importance across the entire dataset.LIME (Local): Explains individual patient predictions to assist clinicians in specific case analysis.Real-Time Interface: A user-friendly interface (CLI/Web) allowing medical staff to input patient data and receive immediate risk assessments.📊 MethodologyThe project follows a structured pipeline designed for medical data complexity:Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, encoding categorical variables (diagnosis codes, specialties), and normalizing numeric features .Handling Class Imbalance: Applying SMOTE to generate synthetic minority samples and Tomek Links to remove boundary noise.Model Training: Training a CatBoost Classifier with hyperparameter optimization (Learning rate, Tree depth, L2 regularization).Explainability Integration: Generating SHAP force plots and LIME visualizations for transparency.Deployment: Integration into a real-time input system.📂 DatasetThe model is trained on a pre-processed version of the Diabetes 130-US hospitals dataset (1999–2008).Records: ~25,000 patient encounters (balanced subset).Features: 17 features including demographics, lab tests (HbA1c, Glucose), hospital utilization (time in hospital, procedures), and medication history .Feature CategoryExamplesDemographicsAge, Race, Gender UtilizationTime in hospital, # Lab procedures, # Inpatient visits ClinicalDiagnosis codes (Circulatory, Respiratory), HbA1c test MedicationNumber of medications, Insulin changes 📈 Results & PerformanceThe model was evaluated on an 80:20 train-test split. It achieved a competitive ROC-AUC of 0.66 and a Recall of 0.68, ensuring that over 60% of actual readmission cases are correctly identified—a critical metric for patient safety.Performance Metrics MetricScoreAccuracy0.62Precision0.63Recall0.68F1-Score0.65ROC-AUC0.66Explainability AnalysisSHAP Analysis: Identified Number of Inpatient Visits, HbA1c Results, and Number of Medications as the top features influencing readmission risk .LIME Analysis: Validated local predictions, showing for example that high emergency visits and insulin usage positively contributed to high-risk classification.🛠️ Tech StackLanguage: PythonMachine Learning: CatBoost, Scikit-learnData Processing: Pandas, NumPy, Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE-Tomek)Explainability: SHAP, LIMEDeployment: Streamlit👥 ContributorsThis project was submitted for the Bachelor of Technology in CSE (AI & ML) at B V Raju Institute of Technology.Pandla Bineesha Suddala Rahul Vuppala Varshith Supervisors:Dr. P.
